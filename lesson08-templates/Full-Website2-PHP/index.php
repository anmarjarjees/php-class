  <!-- Now we need to use php code to include the header.php file -->          
  <?php
/* 
Using a php built-in function to embed/insert the header.php or any php code, why?
Because "header.php" contains the top repeated part (code) in every page

The include(): statement includes and evaluates the specified file.

Example: Below we put 3 times include, the code will be included 3 times
include 'templates/header.php';
include 'templates/header.php';
include 'templates/header.php';

include_once(): 
if the code from a file has already been included, 
it will not be included again. As the name suggests, it will be included just once. 

Example: Below we put 2 times include_once, but the code will be included only one time
include_once 'templates/header.php';
include_once 'templates/header.php';
*/

// include 'templates/header.php';

// include_once 'templates/header.php'; // we can use it with or without ( )
// OR:
// include_once ('templates/header.php'); // This code will NOT be included

/*
Beside the two functions:
- include()
- include_once()

PHP also giving us these two functions:
- require()
- require_once()

They work the same as include and include_once but with only very important difference
*/
// require 'templates/header.php'; // we can use it with or without ( )
// require 'templates/header.php';
// Even if the code below is written 3 times, it will run only one time => "_once"
require_once 'templates/header.php';
require_once 'templates/header.php';
require_once 'templates/header.php';
