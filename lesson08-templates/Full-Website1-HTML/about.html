            <h2>What you need to know about spa!</h2>
            <p>A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give medicinal
                baths.
                Spa towns or spa resorts (including hot springs resorts) typically offer various health treatments,
                which
                are also known as balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to
                prehistoric
                times. Such practices have been popular worldwide, but are especially widespread in Europe and Japan.
                Day
                spas are also quite popular, and offer various personal care treatments.</p>

            <h3 id="Origins">Origins of the term</h3>
            <p>The term is derived from the name of the town of Spa, Belgium, whose name is known back from Roman times,
                when
                the location was called Aquae Spadanae, sometimes incorrectly connected to the Latin word spargere
                meaning
                to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. The word spa itself denotes "fountain". Some experts also suggest that
                the
                word "spa" originated from the name of the Belgian town named Spa where a curative natural spring was
                discovered
                in the 14th century.

            <h3 id="Treat">Treatments</h3>
            <p>A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is non-medical procedure to help the health
                of the
                body. It is often performed at a resort, destination spa, day spa, beauty salon or school.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Trends">Recent trends</h3>
            <p>In the modern world spa therapies are linked to various domains including beauty, pampering, indulgence,
                and
                health. Spa industry is thought to be growing at a significantly high rate, and most importantly it is
                observed
                to embrace wellness as its core business. By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health
                resorts
                were operating in the United States.
